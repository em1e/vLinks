## üõ†Ô∏è What is vLinks?
vLinks is a simple test plugin, which I made to practice the API syntax.

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands:
#### ` /giveflower ` : Gives the player a magical flower, custom item.

#### ` /links ` : Opens a GUI of useful links.
- can also take the following arguments:
  - `youtube` -> Open youtube
  - `website` -> Open the website
  - `discord` -> Discord server invite
  - `help` -> run /help command
  
#### ` /staff_handbook ` : Sends a interactable hyperlink in chat for accessing the staff handbook
- also works with aliases `/handbook` and `/shb`
