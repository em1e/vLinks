## üõ†Ô∏è What is vLinks?
vLinks is a simple test plugin used on a 1.20.6 test server, which I made to practice the API syntax.

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands:
#### ` /flower ` : Gives the player a magical flower (test it out for yourself)

#### ` /links ` : Opens a GUI of useful links.
- can also take the following arguments:
  - `youtube` -> Open Youtube
  - `instagram` -> Open Instagram
  - `github` -> Open Github
  - `discord` -> Discord server invite
  - `help` -> run /help command
  
#### ` /staff_handbook ` : Sends a interactable hyperlink in chat for accessing the staff handbook
- also works with aliases `/handbook` and `/shb`
